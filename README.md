LPG Gas Detector

A simple yet effective LPG gas detection system that monitors gas concentration in real-time using an MQ-series sensor. It alerts users with a buzzer/LED when gas leakage is detected, helping to prevent accidents and improve safety.

📌 Features

Real-time detection of LPG gas leaks.

Alerts through buzzer and LED indicators.

Works with Arduino/ESP boards.

Easy to extend with IoT features (SMS, email, mobile app).

🛠️ Components Used

MQ-series Gas Sensor (e.g., MQ-2 or MQ-5)

Arduino/ESP32/ESP8266 board

Buzzer

LED indicators

Jumper wires & breadboard

⚡ How It Works

The MQ sensor continuously measures the gas concentration.

If the concentration exceeds a threshold, the buzzer and LED are activated.

Optionally, alerts can be sent to IoT platforms for remote monitoring.

🚀 Getting Started

Connect the hardware components as per the circuit diagram.

Upload the provided Arduino code using Arduino IDE.

Power the system and test it by exposing the sensor to LPG (carefully, in a safe setup).
